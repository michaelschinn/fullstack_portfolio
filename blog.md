Today was interesting to say the least. I got a nice refresher on using GitHub! I've used it in the past when I was a front-end web developer. Even so, I've learned that it's suprising all of the things you can forget in 6 years. For example...

## The Process of Utilizing GitHub

- Initialize your local repository.
- Check the status of your local repo.
- Add files to be commited.
- Commit your changes.
- Create an Empty Repository on the GitHub Server
- Push your changes to the GitHub Server.
- Execute a pull request on your changes.
- Create a "Dev" branch
- Merge your changes into the main branch.

## Initializing Your Local Repository

It's the simplest of things that make all the difference. This simple little command...

`git init`

...is where it all begins. With it you can "Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one." ( *From: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)* ) In short, it makes it possible to create branches, commit changes, push said changes up to the server, and so much more! None of this would be possible without initializing a local repository first. 

## Checking the status of your local repo.
`git status`
## Add files to be commited.
`git add -A`
## Commit your changes.
`git commit -m "[message]"`
## Create an Empty Repository on the GitHub Server
### Push your changes to the GitHub Server.
`git push -u origin main`
## Execute a pull request on your changes.
## Creating a Dev branch
## Merge your changes into the main branch.

What's really **Awesome** is that in the past, I never learned to use the GitHub website beyond cloning repos and viewing files. The majority of my experience with it was through a CLI, so it was a real treat to learn the ins and outs of it.

I thank God that I have access to all of the knowledge and experience of the instructors. I can tell that the Bootcamp is going to be a real game changer for me. :)
