# _**Git Over Here!**_
*8/25/2021*

Today was interesting to say the least. I got a nice refresher on using GitHub! I've used it in the past when I was a front-end web dev. Even so, I've learned that it's suprising all of the things you can forget in 6 years.

What's really **Awesome** is that I never learned to use the GitHub website beyond cloning repos and viewing files. The majority of my experience with it was through a CLI, so it was a real treat to learn the ins and outs of it.

I thank God that I have access to all of the knowledge and experience of the instructors. I can tell that the Bootcamp is going to be a real game changer for me. :)
